;; - Length of the empty list is 0.

;; Recursive implementation of counting tree leaves 
;; - count-leaves of the empty list is 0.

;; But in the reduction step, where we strip off the car of the list, 
;; we must take into account that the car may itself be a tree whose leaves 
;; we need to count. Thus, the appropriate reduction step is

;; - Count-leaves of a tree x is count-leaves of the car of x 
;; plus count-leaves of the cdr of x.

;; Finally, by taking cars we reach actual leaves, so we need 
;; another base case:

;; - Count-leaves of a leaf is 1.

;; 2.2.3 Sequences as Conventional Interfaces
;; Abstraction provides ways to design systems without needing to 
;; implementation details. Higher-order functions allowed us to
;; capture patterns common in numerical data.

;; We can conceptualize of another type of symmetry in terms of streaming
;; data - data sent through 'signal processing stages' - filters, 
;; maps (transducer), accumulators.
;; even when a procedure may not structurally reflect the data pipeline
;; model, we can conceptualize its functionality in this way

;; we can also implement these procedures using sequences as conventional
;; interfaces.  We can represent signals - the data that flows from one
;; operation to the next - as lists, so that we can leverage list operations
;; as the processing implementation at each stage
